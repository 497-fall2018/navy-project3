# navy-project3
1. npm install -g expo-cli
2. cd my-app
3. npm install
4. Download Expo on your device (phone)
5. npm start (this should open a tab with Expo XDE, if it does not, go to localhost:19002 on your web)

side note: mine only worked when I used tunnel to connect (instead of LAN or local), but not sure if others would work. Please feel free to test/explore more and update!
